  * Simulation speed is expressed in CPS (cycles per second): 
    + `ArrowUP` and `ArrowDOWN` increase / decrease simulation speed by **1**
    + `PageUP` and `PageDOWN` increase / decrease simulation speed by **10**
    + `SpaceBar` resets simulation default speed (**30**)
  * `Tab` cycles trough living creatures
  * `Shift` cycles trough charts
  * `Escape` quits
- Mouse
  * `MouseRight` lets you pan over the map
  * `MouseLeft` lets you select a creature
